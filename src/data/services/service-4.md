  content: We connect your brand with the right voices. By leveraging authentic creator partnerships, we build trust and drive engagement through campaigns that feel natural, not forced. At Duco İstanbul, we see influencers not as media placements—but as storytellers. We build influencer programs rooted in credibility, audience fit, and long-term brand alignment, not one-off promotions.
