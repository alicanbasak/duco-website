    content: "
      <p>For Cruise Genie, we delivered a bold and data-driven social media strategy with one clear goal: to boost app downloads. Our campaign combined UGC production, influencer marketing, and even the creation of AI-generated influencers to drive interest and engagement.</p>
      <p>We supported this with targeted Dark Ads, striking billboard campaigns, and a unified visual language to connect cruise travelers worldwide with the appâ€”wherever their journey begins.</p>
