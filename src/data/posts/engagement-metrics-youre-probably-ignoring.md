Likes and comments are just the surface. The most valuable engagement insights are hiding in metrics that most marketers never track.

##### 1. Saves (Instagram)

**The Ultimate Intent Signal**

When someone saves your post, they're planning to:
- Reference it later
- Show it to someone else
- Take action on your advice
- Use it for purchase decisions

Track saves/reach ratioâ€”anything above 2% is excellent.

##### 2. DM Replies and Mentions

**Private Engagement Matters**

Story replies and DMs indicate:
- Higher interest level than public comments
- More personal connection to content
- Willingness to start conversations
- Potential for relationship building

##### 3. Profile Clicks from Posts

**Curiosity Conversion**

Profile clicks show:
- Content sparked genuine interest
- People want to learn more about you
- Potential for follower conversion
- Higher quality engagement signal

Track click-to-follow conversion rates.

##### 4. Video Completion Rates

**Beyond Views: Actual Attention**

Different completion rates indicate:
- **25%**: Hook worked, content didn't deliver
- **50%**: Good content, weak conclusion  
- **75%+**: Engaging throughout
- **Replays**: Exceptional value or entertainment

##### 5. Website Traffic from Bio Clicks

**The Business Impact Metric**

Bio link clicks reveal:
- Content drives business outcomes
