Follower count isn't everything. The best influencer partnerships are built on engagement, authenticity, and strategic fit—not vanity metrics.

##### Look Beyond the Numbers

**Engagement Rate > Follower Count**

A creator with 10K engaged followers beats one with 100K passive ones:
- 3-5% engagement is good
- 6-10% engagement is excellent
- Comments matter more than likes
- Saves indicate real value

##### Audience Alignment

**Check Their Community**

- Do their followers match your target audience?
- Are comments genuine or filled with bots?
- What's the demographic breakdown?
- Do they engage with similar brands?

##### Content Quality Assessment

**Evaluate Their Creative Skills**

- Consistent visual style
- Strong storytelling ability
- Professional content production
- Brand integration feels natural

##### Values and Brand Fit

**Alignment Matters More Than Reach**

- Do they share your brand values?
- Have they worked with competitors?
- What's their reputation in the industry?
- Do they actually use products they promote?

##### Professional Approach

**Work With Real Professionals**

- Respond to emails promptly
- Meet deadlines consistently
- Provide usage rights and deliverables
- Transparent about rates and terms

##### Red Flags to Avoid

**Warning Signs**
- Sudden follower spikes (bought followers)
- Generic engagement patterns
- Too many sponsored posts
- Controversial past content

##### The Duco Vetting Process

Our influencer selection framework:

1. **Quantitative Analysis**: Engagement, reach, demographics
2. **Qualitative Review**: Content quality, brand alignment
3. **Community Check**: Audience authenticity and relevance
4. **Professional Assessment**: Communication and reliability
5. **Strategic Fit**: Campaign objectives and brand goals

Remember: The right influencer feels like a natural brand ambassador, not a hired spokesperson.

Choose wisely. Build relationships. Create authentic connections.
