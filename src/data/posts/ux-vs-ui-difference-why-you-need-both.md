Often confused but never the same—UX and UI serve different purposes in creating exceptional digital experiences.

Understanding this distinction is crucial for building products that users love.

##### What is UX (User Experience)?

UX is about the **how**—how your product works, feels, and flows.

It's the invisible architecture that makes everything intuitive:
- User research and personas
- Information architecture 
- User flows and wireframes
- Usability testing and iteration

##### What is UI (User Interface)?

UI is about the **what**—what users see, touch, and interact with.

It's the visual layer that brings experiences to life:
- Visual design and color palettes
- Typography and iconography
- Interactive elements and micro-animations  
- Component libraries and design systems

##### Why You Need Both

Great products happen when UX and UI work in harmony:

**UX without UI** = A well-planned house with no interior design
**UI without UX** = A beautiful house you can't navigate

##### The Duco Approach

At Duco İstanbul, we never separate UX from UI. Our process integrates both:

1. **Research First**: Understanding users before designing
2. **Prototype Early**: Testing flows before visual design
3. **Design Systems**: Creating consistent, scalable interfaces
4. **Continuous Testing**: Validating both usability and aesthetics

Remember: Users don't care about the distinction. They want products that work beautifully and look functional.

That's where the magic happens.
