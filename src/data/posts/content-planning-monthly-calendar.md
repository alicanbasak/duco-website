Behind every consistent brand is a smart content calendar. It's not just a planning tool—it's a strategic weapon.

At Duco İstanbul, our calendars balance storytelling, sales, community, and culture.

##### 1. Start with Pillars

Break your content into 3–5 recurring themes:

- Product Education
- Behind the Scenes
- Testimonials / Social Proof
- Cultural Moments
- Campaign Promos

##### 2. Mix Formats & Intent

Balance visuals, videos, and text.

- Educational carousel
- Trend-based reel
- Poll or AMA

Each week should balance awareness, engagement, and conversion.

##### 3. Use Real Data

Use platform analytics to:

- Find top-performing time slots
- Repurpose evergreen content
- Know what to stop doing

##### 4. Schedule & Adapt

Use tools like Notion, Later, or Buffer. Leave room for real-time content (trends, reactions).

**Consistency isn't about rigidity. It's about having a rhythm that's smart, agile, and on-brand.**
